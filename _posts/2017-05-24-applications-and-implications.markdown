## **DIY Fabricated Digital Clock**

# **High School (Grades 9-12) Lesson Plan**


      What will it do?
      - Run a generic code to tell a 12-hour time, and be able to set
       it up with 2 button controls.

--------------------------

      Who's done what beforehand?

      - As the teacher, I would prepare a schematic from Eagle laying
       out all nessessary components for the students to connect and
       then trace for the Roland MDX-20 milling machine. I will also
       prepare a generic code for them all to send into their chip.

--------------------------

      
      What materials and components will be required?

      - Casing material will include either 3D printer filiment
      (3mm) or 1/4" acrylic measureing 24"x12" for our laser
      cutters. All electrical components for the original circuit
      and surface-mount circuit are shown on this link here:

<br>

--------------------------
      
      Where will they come from?

      - Most of the parts on my spreadsheet are provided from the
      Fab Lab Inventory. Any part not included come from multiple
      vendors shown in the chart as well as URLs on websites to buy
      them from.

---------------------------
      
      How much will it cost?

      - Most pieces range from 25 cents-$5 a piece. All prices that
      I found are listed beside the vendors on the spreadsheet link
      above. *Casing materials can be 3D printer filiment (priceless
      depending on quantity) or 1/4" acrylic which I can make x6
      projects per 1 (24"x12") sheet, which is $18-ish. 5V power
      adapters have been donated to us by our tech department but
      would be under $5 a piece.

--------------------------

      What parts and systems will be made?

      - Both the circuit board and enclosure for it.

--------------------------

      What processes will be used?

      - Both computer controlled cutting (Lasercutter) or 3D
      printing for the enclosure. The circuit itself shows practice
      in electronic production, design, and programming in a
      easy-to-understand application.

-------------------------

      What tasks need to be completed?

      - Waiting for the rest of my ordered SMD components to solder on
      - Testing out my prototype board to see an active connection
      - Programming a generic code into the chip
      - Assembling time (glues, pressure-fitted, etc.)

------------------------

      What questions need to be answered?

      - Will the schematic I made be enough to run this board
      successfully?
      - Will I be able to find a generic clock code to copy from,
      or will I have to write it all from scratch?

------------------------

      What is the schedule?

      - Complete the soldering and programming of the board. Last
      step is to assemble the casing around it once the board
      tests successfully.

-----------------------

      How will it be evaluated?

      - Can it successfully tell the time and have an accurate
      timer on it to not lose any seconds?
      - Does 7-segment diplay work accurately?
      - Does the circuit board fit securely in the casing without
      movement?
