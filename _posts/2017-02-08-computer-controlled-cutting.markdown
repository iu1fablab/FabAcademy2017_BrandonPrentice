# **Universal Pencil Holder Kit**

The project I did to introduce me to parametric fitting and the Fusion 360 design software was an idea to make a universal kit in order to make as big or as small of a pencil holder as possible, all lasercut from cardboard. The pieces to design would be simple; a top/bottom piece and a side piece that can be also used to connect other holders next to them.

Starting with Fusion 360, I created my first sketches utilizing many of the basic tools in order to have a pencil holder size of 4" X 5". The material thickness for the cardboard would end up being 0.125", so I designed all of the pressure-fitted slots to be 0.122" X 0.5". Below shows my process of designing sketch, exporting it into a .DXF file, importing that select file into CorelDRAW, and then finally setting it up on the lasercutter.

Overall, I was pleased with my 1st prototype. The joints which I made 0.122" were a little more snug than usual but it all still came together nicely. Somthing that I would improve next time is lining up the pencil holes more accurately so that the "filler" pieces that tie more than one component together lines up to the main ones (utilizing even more spots to hold pencils).

# **Chandelier Construction Kit**

Another project I decided to do that is pressure fitted and can have have multiple methods of assembly is a chandelier project. The idea for this came when the Intermediate Unit 1 asked about one month ago for an idea to have students all participate in the FabLab while displaying their work at our Central Office.

I started by first freehanding a sketch from CorelDRAW to create the base. I used what I call a "50/50" slot method which I learned from constructing lab stools for our Fab Lab in the past. I made the slots perfectly to fit the 0.25" clear acrylic that we thought would look best in sunlight. Each half of the base took almost an entire sheet which made it 2 feet tall. I also made an alternative page to draw out various kinds of arms to stick out from the base. I settled on one design and then had all of the pieces lasercut.

Once the pieces were all cut, I began to assemble the 2-part base. For saftey of the tight pressure fitted slot to someday get loose from hanging high off the cieling, I used acrylic cement to permanently seal the bond between the two pieces. The extended arms however, I left temporary to be interchanged between different styles of arms. I ended up using a "square slotted joint" which requires a small square key to keep the components locked together. See below:

<img src="{{ "IMGs/2laser8.jpg" | relative_url }}" alt="laser pic 8" height="200">
</center>

<br>
Now for the rest of the chandelier, my goal was to get as many students as possible to simply design one piece each to hang from the base. Every piece was to be unique with a simple text/image to engrave onto. I split the students into three catagories:

Group 1- 0.75 x 2" Rectangle Pieces (0.25 clear acrylic)

Group 2- 0.75 x 2" Oval Pieces (0.25 clear acrylic)

Group 3- 1.25 x 1.25" Circle Pieces (0.125 red acrylic)

All pieces were then assembled onto base using fishing line from the small laser cut holes I created on the base/arms.
