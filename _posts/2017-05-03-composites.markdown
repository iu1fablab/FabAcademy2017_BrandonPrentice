This was my process for toolpathing a 3D object, CNC milling it, and creating an epoxy mask over it to vacuum seal and form a composite.

**3D Object:** Boat

**CNC Mill:** Shopbot

**Software:** Aspire

I started by importing a .STL file of a boat shape into our Aspire software. I then created the appropriate toolpaths with one roughing path (0.25" end mill bit), and one finishing path (0.125" ballnose bit). I ended up using a scrap piece of packaging styrofoam that was laying around to be my material (5"x11"x2")

The next procedure I did was getting all of the materials laid out and cut to size. The supplies needed for my assignment were:

1. One Epoxy and CCF Hardener jugs (Part A&B)
2. x3 fiber sheets cut to mold size (cloth)
3. x2 Release film sheets cut to mold size
4. Measuring cups and brushes

Afterwards, I took the pre-cut pieces of fabric and then cut darts into them to better fit around the mold.

*Apply in well-ventilated room*

*Always wear safety glasses and gloves*

My last step was then creating the composite itself. I thoroughly mixed parts A & B together at a 2/1 ratio and brushed the solution onto each layer of cloth. I made sure to also place a layer of release film on the top as well as on the mold itself. Finally, I placed the entire composite inside of a vacuum bag and used our powerful dust collection system to suck the air out. I used a combination of a shop vac extention and the 3D printed hose adapter to securly fit the hose on the bag. Once it was done vacuuming, I let it sit for 24 hours before I trimmed the edges.
