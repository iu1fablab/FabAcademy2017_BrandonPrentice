# **Constructing a Vinyl Roll Rack**

<br>
**Software:** CorelDRAW into V-carve Pro

**CNC Mill:** Shopbot

**Material:** 1/2" Plywood (4ft x 8ft Sheet)

**Toolbit:** 1/4" Solid Carbide Down Cut (57-910)

I started my design from scratch, using CorelDRAW to map out all of my specific lines/shapes to be pressure-fitted and eventually screwed together. I find CorelDRAW to have a lot more vectoring features and easier to use than V-Carve Pro (Only with the node-editing aspect). I then imported a .PDF version from CorelDraw to setup the specific tool paths for the milling machine shown below:

The design I sketched out was made to have slotted cross braces for support and dado grooves in the back to fit additional arms. All design to be pressurefitted, but also reenforced with 1.25" wood screws to support a lot of extra weight coming from x12 vinyl rolls. All cuts were profile toolpaths with the exception of the back grooves that were pocketed out.

Once assembled, I varnished, sanded, and mounted the rack onto our metal studs using sheet metal screws.
