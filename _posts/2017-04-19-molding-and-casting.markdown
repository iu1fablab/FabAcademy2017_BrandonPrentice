This was my process for toolpathing a 3D object, CNC milling it, casting with silicon rubber, and lastly making the mold from a metal alloy.

**3D Object:** Albert Einstein Bust

**CNC Mill:** Shopbot

**Software:** V-Carve Pro

I started by searching the web on [Thingiverse][thingiverse] to search for a detailed bust. Once I pulled the appropriate .STL file, I imported it to V-carve Pro, where I manipulated it to fit inside of a rectangle shape I designed onto a 2"x6"x24" substrate (wood piece). I did have to flatten the bust quite a bit in order to properly cut into only a 1.5" piece of lumber. The finished designed was made into three toolpaths: 3D roughing with 0.25" ballnose bit, 3D finishing with 0.25" ballnose bit, and 3D finishing with 0.125" ballnose bit.

My next step was then creating the castof the 3D bust. Because I was melting metal for the mold, I used a special high temperature silicon rubber, called Mold Max 60, that can withstand temperatures up to 560 degrees Fahrenheit. I spray mold release onto the wood design and then started stiring part A&B of the silicon together.

The wait time for the silicon rubber to dry was 24 hours. On that next day, I prepared everything needed for the mold. The metal is an alloy called Roto 281F/138C Low Melt Bismuth Based Alloy, which is made of 58% bismuth and 42% tin. This metal has a melting temperature of about 300 Degree Fahrenheit. Since the metal is very soft, I cut it in half with our bansaw to fit in our crucible.

**Lessons Learned:** From seeing the final result, I would change up the CNC wood design a little to get better results. The face looks a little too flat and plus the way his hair isn't carved in as well sacrificed that detail in the end. I would re-evaluate getting a different material that would be thicker than 1.5" to accomodate more of the bust without flattening the design too much.
