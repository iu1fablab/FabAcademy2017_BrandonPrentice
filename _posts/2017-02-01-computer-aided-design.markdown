The final project idea is to adapt what I've been learning in Fab Academy to create a project that can be used as an advance high school lesson. This project is to design and program a copper-traced board that is cut from our milling machines. Once the circuit is done, a casing will then be designed and created from one of many fabrication processes we offer in our Fab Lab program.

For this assignment I will be designing an enclosure for the circuit. I looked around for a through-hole kit that was already designed to base the dimensions off of.

# **Designing a Casing Through Vectors (Adobe Illustrator)**

I started by utilizing [www.makercase.com][makercase] which is a simple sketch generator to design a basic box shape with a percise finger joint layout. I chose this program because of it all being parametric, and good for projects with joinery. Once I plugged in the few parameter questions, it generated a .SVG file which can then be pulled into other vectoring software. I decided to experiment with Adobe Illustrator by importing, designing, and manipulating the file that will somday be either lasercut or CNC milled.

**Using Adobe Illustrator:**

To make this kind of design, I knew I would need a software that is great with node editing features that is also better than Inkscape. I've personally only used CorelDRAW in my lab during my time here as manager so I wanted to see the difference in this software. Obviously, the 2 liscenses are more alike than different. The only major differences is the tool layouts and labels for those tool features.

**Features Used:**

>Type Tool (With Features)

>Various Line Segment Tools

>Direct Select Tool (Node Editing)

>Image Trace (Pixels into Vectors)

# **Designing a Casing Through 3D Modeling (Google SketchUp)**

As a option for our students, I am considering 3D printing as a viable option to create their casing. Below is a version I made that took just around 1-2 hours to print, which is considerable time for me to instruct a small class from my mobile lab.

**Using Google SketchUp:**

To incorporate the 3D modeling aspect for my project, I thought of using SketchUp as my primary learning tool. I've taught in Elem/Middle school areas when it comes to this kind of 3D printing where it can be simple, fun, and very accessable to the students. Other software that I have used for this kind of application include Tinkercad & 123D Design. I always found those two programs very similar on how they manipulate shapes and wanted to go a slightly different way. SketchUp is free like the others so I found this appealing to adapt in these same sort of classes I teach, where even younger students can load this program on their own personal computer.

I started with a simple cube shape where I subtracted away all of the hollow areas that you see in the pictures below. Once I made my guesses on where to put the openings for the buttons & 7-segment display, I "pushed" the 2D shapes inward to subtrate the material away. My last step was to add the 3D text on top, extruding it in such a way that I can switch colors of filiment during prints to bring out more contrast.
