For Sarah and I's input device, we used Eagle to design and trace a circuit that connects to our Satshakit (Arduino Uno Clone) to read a temperature sensor, which is a variable resistor that works as a voltage divider in order to send varying voltages to the Arduino serial monitor.  These varying voltages are read as temperature levels which you can change the range of voltages on.

**Components Needed:**

>Arduino Clone (Satshakit) Board

>Breadboard

>7 Male Pin Headers

>X3 499Î© Resistors

>X3 LEDs (Red, Orange, & Blue)

>Temperature Sensor (LM35)

**Designing the Traces:**

>HEADER PIN 1 - Pin one (the pin on the left) of the temperature sensor goes to 5v 

>HEADER PIN 2 - Pin two (the pin in the middle) of the temperature sensor goes to analog pin A2

>HEADER PIN 3 - Pin three (the pin on the right) of the temperature sensor goes to ground

>HEADER PIN 4 - Red LED through one of the resistors, and ground

>HEADER PIN 5 - Orange LED though a resistor, and ground

>HEADER PIN 6 - Blue LED through a resistor, and ground

>HEADER PIN 7 - GROUND (For LEDs/Resistors)

**Coding**

The basic understanding when making the code was first assigning all of the individual arduino pins to the LEDS/Temp Sensor, and then having a series HIGHS/LOWS listed to light up the specific LED per range of temperatures, along with a quick message stating cold, fine, and hot.

I was researching for good resources to start on a temperature-reading program. I found an excellent page to start me in the right direction when it came to making the SMD schematic along with the program itself, which I had to alter slightly. See source here: [Arduino LED Temperature Indicator] [tempsense]

[tempsense]: http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-LED-Temperature-Indicator/

The program is set so that a **BLUE LED** will turn on when temperature is below **75 degrees**, an **ORANGE LED** turn on when it's **73-80 degrees**, and  a **RED LED** turn on when it's above **80 degrees**. Below are the connections Sarah and I made, followed by the program we used to run the input device using Arduino IDE and it's built in serial monitor:

**Problems Encountered:**

This was actually my second attempt on a Temp sensor circuit. The original one was using a SMD temperature sensor with 1 indicator light displaying with certain brightness. I decided to make it simplier with a more common (through-hole) Temp sensor that I can assign individual LEDs to for easier programming.
